# Exercise 1

Write a PHP program that receives an address as a single string. The program should then, using a loop, print out the address one line at a time in a webpage. For example, if the address as a single string is "10 Downing Street, Whitehall, London, SW1", the program should print out 
10 Downing Street 
Whitehall 
London 
SW1

Write a webpage containing a form that allows a user to enter an address. When the user clicks submit, call the PHP program above to format the address and display it.
