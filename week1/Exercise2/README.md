# Exercise 2

Create a database table in MySQL (using your university PHPMyAdmin account) containing data for employees of PHPCo. Ltd., such as:

Name   Dept.	Salary

Brian	Sales	30000

Sally	Operations	50000

Cal	Sales	35000

Jill	Sales	42000

Write a PHP program that will take the name of a dept. and print out all employees in that dept. and their salary. Write a webpage containing a form that allows users to enter a dept. name and submit it to the PHP program. In other words, users should be able to enter a dept. name, click submit and then see all employees in that dept. and their salaries.
